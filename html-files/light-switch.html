    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This project started as an idea that if I was laying in my bed and didn't want to get up and turn the lights off that I can turn them off through my phone.
       First, in order to control the light switch I would have a raspberry pi hooked up to a servo motor and with some 3D parts the lights would be flicked on or off.
       In order to control the raspberry pi with my phone, I needed to install an Apache server so it can host the website I would make for the actual remote to flick the light on and off.
       After installing Apache the next step is to make the website. I used HTML/CSS/JS as the front end and used PHP as the back end. The front end would have buttons labeled "on" and "off".
       When pressed the button would activate the php file sending its title in return would call a Python script to turn the light on or off.</p>
